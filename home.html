    <b>Here are some things to know about HTML: 
 
        Markup
        HTML uses markup symbols or codes to tell web browsers how to display a page's words and images. Each piece of markup code is called an element or a tag, and they are usually between the characters "<" and ">". 
        <p> 
        Structure
        HTML can structure content in a variety of ways, such as paragraphs, lists, images, and data tables. 
    </p>
        Accessibility
        HTML can help improve accessibility for users with disabilities by specifying the language of a page. 
        This allows screen readers and other assistive technologies to read the page's content correctly. 
        Collaboration
        Good code practice can make it easier to collaborate with other developers,
        update the website in the future, and hand off the code when a developer is no longer working on it. 
        Technologies
        HTML is often used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages like JavaScript.
